## Covid 19 Data Exploration 
## Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

## Select data we are going to use
SELECT 
location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, 
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
ORDER BY 1,2;

## Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths
SELECT 
location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
WHERE
location = 'Pakistan'
ORDER BY 1,2;

## Looking at Total Cases vs Population
## Shows what percentage of population got covid
SELECT 
location, date, total_cases, population, (total_cases/population)*100 AS percent_population_infected
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
WHERE
location = 'Pakistan'
ORDER BY 1,2;

## Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
SELECT 
location, population, MAX(total_cases) as highest_infection_count, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS percent_population_infected
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY percent_population_infected DESC;

##  Countries with Lowest Death Rate compared to Population
SELECT 
location, population, MIN(total_deaths) as lowest_death_count, MIN((total_deaths/population))*100 AS percent_population_death
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY percent_population_death DESC;

## Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
SELECT 
location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) as total_death_count
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
WHERE continent is not null 
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY total_death_count DESC;

## BREAKING THINGS DOWN BY CONTINENT
## Showing contintents with the highest death count per population
SELECT 
continent, MAX(CAST(total_deaths as int)) as total_death_count
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
WHERE continent is not null 
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY total_death_count DESC;

## GLOBAL NUMBERS
SELECT 
SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(CAST(new_deaths as int))/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
FROM
centering-sweep-399611.portfolio_project.covid_deaths
WHERE continent is not null 
-- GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1,2;

## Total Population vs Vaccinations
## Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine
SELECT 
deaths.continent, deaths.location, deaths.date, deaths.population, vaccinations.new_vaccinations,
SUM(CAST(vaccinations.new_vaccinations AS int64)) OVER (Partition by deaths.location ORDER BY deaths.location, deaths.date) AS rolling_people_vaccinated
